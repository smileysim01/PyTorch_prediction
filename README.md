# PyTorch_prediction

In this project, we've used PyTorch to create a regression model that can predict how many deaths there will be for a WI census tract, given the number of people who have tested positive, broken down by age. The train.csv and test.csv files are based on this dataset: 
https://data.dhsgis.wi.gov/datasets/wi-dhs::covid-19-vaccination-data-by-census-tract

Learning objectives:

multiply tensors;

use GPUs (when available);

optimize inputs to minimize outputs;

use optimization to optimize regression coefficients
